This directory should contain the complete works of Shakespeare.  The data itself is not part of this
repository so that there's no risk of copyright infringement.  The way I recommend you get it is to:

* Go to the Project Gutenberg site and find their "The Complete Works of William Shakespeare" -- as of
  this writing, it's at https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100
* Download the "Plain text" version into this directory, and name it "input.txt"
* Edit it, and remove the Project Gutenberg-specific front and end matter (it's because of this removal
  that I wasn't comfortable adding it to the repo).
