The input.txt in here is a concatenation of the raw markdown for all of my published blog posts
as of 2025-09-18.  No copyright issues with that :-)

The build.py script is only likely to be useful for me -- it just copies the files from a checkout
of my blog's source into input.txt so that I can easily update after posting new stuff, so that
it's easy for me to keep this fresh (not that I expect to do so for very long).
